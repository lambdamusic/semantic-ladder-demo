## Why each miss was marked

**Q6.** Why is Valdoria Telecom's foreign-currency rating lower than its local-currency rating?

- `csv` run 1: Names the BB Country Ceiling as capping foreign-currency ratings, but does not say it doesn't cap local-currency ratings (only implied by the BBB- local rating).
- `csv` run 3: Identifies the BB country ceiling as likely capping the FC rating, but hedges that the data states no reason and does not explicitly say the ceiling applies to FC and not LC ratings.
- `executed` run 1: Names the BB Country Ceiling as consistent with the FC rating, but hedges that no reason is stated and never says the ceiling caps foreign-currency but not local-currency ratings.
- `executed` run 3: Identifies the BB country ceiling matching the FC rating, but hedges that no cause is stated and never says the ceiling caps only foreign-currency ratings, not local-currency ones.
- `executed` run 4: Names the BB country ceiling as consistent with the FC rating but hedges ('data doesn't state a reason') and never says the ceiling caps FC and not LC ratings.
- `executed` run 5: Notes the BB ceiling and that FC sits at it, but says no reason is stated and never states that the ceiling caps FC and not LC ratings, so it does not name the ceiling as the cause.
